Detailed project plan for analyzing the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset

### 1. **Data Understanding**
   - **Goal**: Gain familiarity with the data and understand the key features and their roles.
   - **Actions**:
     - **Dataset Overview**: Load the dataset and inspect it. Review the number of records and features.


### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Goal**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis and machine learning tasks.
   - **Actions**:
    
     - **Validity Check**: Perform validity checks for all indicators except `BMI` and `ID` to ensure that their values fall within the expected ranges. This verification is essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that each indicator has appropriate, predefined values before proceeding with analysis.
         - The reason for not validating `BMI` could be that it is a continuous feature with a wide and natural range of values that can vary significantly depending on individual characteristics. Unlike categorical indicators with fixed valid values, `BMI` can naturally have outliers that represent valid and important data, especially in the context of health-related studies. Removing or altering these values might lead to loss of significant information, such as identifying individuals at extreme health risks, which is crucial for a diabetes-related analysis.
     - **Aggregation Index**:Indicators were summarized based on papers on domain knowledge
            - A factor combining `HighBP` and `HighChol` represent overall cardiovascular risk.
            - A factor combining `Fruits` and `Veggies`  represent diet quality.
            - A factor combining `Smoker` and `HvyAlcoholConsump` represent unhealthy behavior.
            - A factor combining `AnyHealthcare` and `NoDocbcCost` represent healthcare accessibility.
     - **Data Transformation**: Scale continuous variables such as `Age`, `Income`, and `BMI` using Min-Max scaling.
     - **Class Imbalance**: Check for class imbalance in the target variable (`Diabetes_binary`). If needed, apply oversampling techniques such as SMOTE or undersampling to balance the dataset.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Goal**: Gain insights into relationships between features and the target variable.
   - **Actions**:
     - **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute summary statistics for each feature (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) using Spark’s `describe()` function.
     - **Correlation Analysis**: Use correlation heatmaps to visualize relationships between the numeric features and the target variable.
     - **Univariate Analysis**: Visualize the distribution of individual features like `Age`, `BMI`, `Income` to detect trends in healthy vs. diabetic populations.
     - **Bivariate Analysis**: Analyze relationships between pairs of variables, such as `BMI` and `Diabetes_binary`, `HighChol` and `Diabetes_binary`, using box plots or scatter plots.
     - **Chi-square Tests**: For categorical variables, run chi-square tests to check their independence with the target variable.

### 4. **Feature Engineering and Dimensionality Reduction**
   - **Goal**: Reduce dimensionality and explore latent structures within the dataset while retaining important information.
   - **Actions**:
     - **Principal Components Analysis (PCA)**: 
       - Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify the most important principal components.
       - Visualize the explained variance to determine how many components should be retained.
       - Analyze how each feature contributes to the principal components and whether patterns related to diabetes emerge.
     - **Factor Analysis**:
       - Perform factor analysis to identify underlying latent variables that could explain relationships between the observed variables.
       - Interpret the factors in relation to health indicators and lifestyle variables. 
### 5. **Machine Learning Algorithms**
   - **Goal**: Implement a broader set of machine learning algorithms to explore different approaches to classification.
   - **Actions**:
     - **Logistic Regression**: Baseline for binary classification.
     - **Decision Trees**: Non-linear model to handle interactions between features.
     - **Random Forests**: Ensemble method to improve performance through multiple decision trees.
     - **Gradient-Boosted Tree (GBT)**: 
       - Explore Gradient-Boosted Tree for high accuracy and efficient training.
     - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Linear and non-linear kernels to handle complex decision boundaries.
     - **Naive Bayes**: Useful for handling categorical variables and class imbalance.
     - **Neural Networks**:
       - Implement a simple feed-forward neural network to explore deep learning approaches.
       - Use Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from Spark’s MLlib for classification.
     - **AutoML Algorithms**: 
       - Consider using AutoML frameworks (such as H2O.ai or TPOT) to automatically search for the best model and hyperparameters.

### 6. **Model Comparison and Tuning**
   - **Goal**: Thoroughly compare a larger variety of models to select the best performing one.
   - **Actions**:
     - Use cross-validation to compare the performance of each algorithm based on:
       - **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC**.
     - Use **Grid Search** or **Random Search** to optimize hyperparameters for each model.
     - Select the final model based on a combination of predictive power, interpretability, and computational efficiency.

### 7. **Final Reporting and Documentation**
   - **Goal**: Summarize the findings and document the results.
   - **Actions**:
     - **Summary of Findings**: Present key insights from the EDA and predictive modeling, such as which features are the strongest predictors of diabetes and their impact.
     - **Model Interpretation**: Explain how the model predicts diabetes using interpretable AI techniques. Utilize **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to interpret individual predictions and **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand the global feature importance and their effects on predictions.
     - **Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, provide actionable insights, such as lifestyle or health recommendations for diabetes prevention.

### Tools and Libraries:
- **Apache Spark (PySpark)**: For distributed data processing and machine learning.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations (EDA, feature importance).
- **Scikit-learn**: For additional machine learning models and evaluations.
- **LIME/SHAP**: For model interpretation and understanding feature contributions to the predictions.
